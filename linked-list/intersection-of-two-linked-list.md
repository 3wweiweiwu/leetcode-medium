| What's Naive Solution?         | Convert Linked List into Dictionary                                                                                                                                      | Time: O(m+n) space:O(m+n) |
| How to reduce space complexity | Run a+b and b+a, worst case, worst case, it will fail at (m+n), in case there is similar link, it will fail at (s1+s2), where s1 and s2 are leading unshared linked list |
| How to implement the logic?    | ptA==ptB as ending condition                                                                                                                                             |
